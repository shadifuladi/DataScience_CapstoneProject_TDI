    "The data includes 180K observation and the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Channel ID**, assigned to each chat message initiated corresponding to a listing. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creation timestamp** corresponding to each sent message.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The role of each **user** (applicant or resident). \n",

    "* The **market** as in the city where the listing is located. \n",

    "* And finally, the **messages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through initial exploration of the dataset, the following observations are made: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, the number of messages exchanged every month is drastically increasing. Meaning more clients are using the application, looking up rooms, and interact via the messaging feature. However, the number of successful leases shows a minor increase, which could mean that despite more significant engagement and usage, the number of successful leases is not growing at the same speed.  \n",
    "<img src=\"images/message_per_month.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* More applicants engage and send messages compared with the residents. This could be particularly interesting considering that there is usually more than one resident in each household. This could indicate that not all the residents within a household are engaging in the chat messages, while they all should vote on accepting or refusing an applicant. In other words, it could be an indication of lower engagement of residents in the process. \n",

    "\n",
    "Using natural language processing techniques, the sentiment around each text message is evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, [Stanford CoreNLP API](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html) sentiment tool is used to extract the sentiment score of each sentence in a message. The Sentiment Annotator of CoreNLP implements [Socher et al.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf)'s sentiment model by attaching a binary tree in the sentence level. The Node of the tree contains the predicted class and scores for that subtree. The current version of the sentiment annotator of CoreNLP includes five score classes: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "I extract the probability distribution associated with the five score classes (very negative to very positive) for each sentence within a message to record the sentiment scores of text messages. A score of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 is assigned to the five classes, and with that, the expected score for each sentence is calculated as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_i = \\sum_{j=1}^5 P_{i,j}(s) \\times s_{i,j} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{i}$ is expected score corresponding to sentence *i*, and $P_j$ is the probability associated with each score class, $s_j$ in (-2,-1,0,1,2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the frequency of score classes for a text message is calculated by taking the histogram of expected scores of all sentences. Furthermore, The average of expected scores of sentences is calculated to indicate the overall score of a whole text message. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of sentences and words for each message is recorded through this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See the [sentiment analysis notebook](https://github.com/shadifuladi/DataScience_CapstoneProject_TDI/blob/main/notebooks/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) for further information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications \n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of sentiment score of all messages shows a multimodal distribution (figure below), with a pretty dominant peak of neutral messages as expected. Most messages intuitively include unbiased content introducing oneself, exchanging contacts to meet in person, etc. There are two smaller peaks observed at negative and positive scores. These messages could include more signaling content. I took a closer look into the messages that contain a higher ratio of negatively scored sentences. Interestingly, most of these messages had more conflicting content, and a pipeline to identify such messages can be an excellent tool for the company to improve the clients' experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sentiment_distribution.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering the thousands of messages sent daily (figure below) and flagging only the highly signaling messages enables the customer service unit to (better) identify clients' concerns and therefore be able to address them more effectively. \n",
