    "In particular, [Stanford CoreNLP API](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html) sentiment tool is used to extract the sentiment score of each sentence in a message. The Sentiment Annotator of CoreNLP implements [Socher et al.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf)'s sentiment model by attaching a binary tree in the sentence level. The Node of the tree contains the predicted class and scores for that subtree. The current version of the sentiment annotator of CoreNLP includes five score classes: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To record the sentiment scores of text messages, this notebook extracts the probability distribution associated with the 5 score classes (very negative to very positive) for each sentence within a message. A score of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 is assigned to the 5 classes, and with that, the expected score for each sentence is calculated as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_i = \\sum_{j=1}^5 P_{i,j}(s) \\times s_{i,j} $$ \n",

    "where $E_{i}$ is expected score corresponding to sentence *i*, and $P_j$ is the probability associated with each score class, $s_j$ in (-2,-1,0,1,2). \n",

    "Ultimately, the frequency of score classes for a text message is calculated by taking the histogram of expected scores of all sentences. Furthermore, The average of expected scores of sentences is calculated to indicate the overall score of a whole text message. \n",

    "The distribution of sentiment score of all messages shows a multimodal distribution (figure below), with a pretty dominant peak of neutral messages as expected. Most messages intuitively include unbiased content introducing oneself, exchanging contacts to meet in person, etc. There are two smaller peaks observed at negative and positive scores. These messages could include more signaling content. I took a closer look into the messages that contain a higher ratio of negatively scored sentences. Interestingly, most of these messages had more conflicting content, and a pipeline to identify such messages can be an excellent tool for the company to improve the clients' experience. \n",

    "Filtering the thousands of messages sent via the application each day and flagging a number of highly signaling messages that the customer service unit could process allows the company to identify clients' concerns and therefore be able to address them more effectively. \n",
